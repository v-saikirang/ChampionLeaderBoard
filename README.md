# Champion Management Platform 

## Introduction:
The Champion Management Platform is a custom Teams app that enables organizations to onboard and maintain champions/ SME in their organization in Teams, allowing everyone discover Champions right where they collaborate. Utilize this template for multiple scenarios, such as new initiative adoption, champion onboarding, or to maintain organization-wide Subject Matter Experts.

The app provides an easy interface for designated users to add members to the champion program, preview, collaborate and communicate and build a community of power users and coaches.  <br/>

![CMP Screen](./Images/WelcomeCMP.png)                   

## How it works:

1.	The current version of the Champion Management Platform operates as an app in Microsoft Teams that is installed locally in your tenant by your tenant administrator or any user who has the capability to side load the application.
2.  Once installed, it can be accessed via “+Add a tab”  option at the top of the channel within a team. ***Channel > Add a tab > Champion Management Platform*** or from accessing the platform as a personal app on the left rail by ***Selecting "..." for more apps in left rail of Teams > searching for Champion Management Platform***
3.	The app installation process will create a SharePoint site “ChampionManagementPlatform” and SharePoint list (Members List ) in this site to store all users who are nominated to be a champion. Two additional lists(“Events List” and “Events Track Details”) are created to track the events and points. A local administrator is responsible for maintaining this SharePoint list. This person can be the individual who manages the Champion program for the organization or his/her delegate.
4.	The app provides an easy interface for approved employees (Champions) to showcase their Focus area, preview, collaborate and even add their colleagues as new champions.
5.	There are 3 major components in Champion Management Platform. 
..a.	Champion management
..b.	Leaderboard 
..c.	Digital badging
6.	The Champions will be earning points for hosting events, writing Blogs, moderating Office hours etc., Leaderboard ranks all the champions based on their points globally, regionally, and even by focus area.
7.	Point accumulation , ranking logic, Event details are configurable by the Admin based on the organization  needs. <br/>

### Champion Leaderboard:

Leaderboard solution is intended to add a gaming aspect to the Teams Champions program by allowing champions to earn points for the various ways they are promoting and supporting the internal adoption of their areas of interest. This also gives an opportunity to reflect their activity in comparison to other champs. Leaderboard has mainly 2 different views based on the role of that employee.
Roles can be categorized as: 
* i.	Admin/Moderator OR Champion
* ii.	Employee 


### Admin/Moderator OR Champion view
In our Champions program, Admin is a Champion by default.  The Champion view is to enable Administrator or Champions to identify all the members of the Champions program. 
<br/>

![Quick Start Guide](./Images/Leaderboard.png)      


#### An Admin / Champion can do the following: 

1.	Access Champion Leaderboard
..a.	To view their current points total.
..b.	To view their Global rank and how they rank against others globally.
..c.	Access their dashboard with list of events they have supported.
..d.	Add and submit upcoming events to earn points associated with it.  Example, hosting office hours can earn 10 points, whereas writing a blog can earn 5 points. 
2.	 Nominate and approve an employee to be a champion (Add members ) 
..a.	An Admin can add employee as a Champion.
..b.	Where as an existing Champion can nominate their peers. Admin will review and approve the nomination.
3.	Earn a digital badge that can be displayed as an overlay on their profile image. *Refer to Digital Badge section. 

### Employee view
Leader board encourages the employees to get connected to the Champions in their organization.
1.	 Every employee can access the Champion Leader board.
2.	Through Champion Leaderboard, an Employee can identify all the Champions globally or can filter by a particular Focus area or by region option.
3.	Employee can also “Become a Champion” by submitting their information.
 <br/>

### Add Members 
Admin and current Champions of the program can nominate(***Add Members***) peers as Champions. Additional responsibility falls on the admin to maintain the Champions SharePoint list. *The approval process stays with the Admin only.*

The Admin can approve/Reject the champion nominations using Manage Approvals screen. 

### Digital Badge ![Champion logo](./Images/Champion_small.png)
Digital Badge is intended to allow Microsoft 365 Champions to apply a ‘Champion’ badge on their profile image. It provides an easy and seamless process to share the recognition as a champion with the team.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the administrator who will install the app has access to following:

SharePoint Admin role 
- Permission to load application package into SharePoint Online
- Permission to approve API requests in SharePoint Online
- Ability to create a site in SharePoint Online

Once the package has been installed, API granted, and solution synced to Teams (steps documented below), the same admin will likely also be asked to complete the first run experience. This first run creates the SharePoint site (ChampionManagementPlatform)
that all assets of this solution will be created under. Additionaly permissions need to be modified by an owner of this site to include edit/contribute rights for the organizations ability to interact with the solution.

#Installation Types (Customized vs Standard)

##Customized Installation
The customized installation makes the assumption you wish to change the default variables (site location, text or visual aspects, etc) with the Champion Management Platform. Customizing the installation takes it outside of 
configurations we have tested against but allows you to modify any aspect of the platform. Below are high level steps to get you started on a customized installation.

### Install NodeJs

1.  Download nodejs from this link 
    https://nodejs.org/ 

2.   Previous Releases | Node.js (nodejs.org) 
    Download node 10.24.0

3.  After downloading the nodejs and installing follow steps as follows

4.  Please open the CMP download folder
    Run Npm install
    And 
    Run npm install -g gulp
    
  *	Global or SharePoint Administrator role in the target tenant
  *	***ChampionManagementPlatform*** project in GitHub
    
### Customize configuration

If desired the administrator can configure the installation location including the customized site, list, and/or column(s) using following steps:

1.	Update the ***"src/webparts/XXXXX/config/siteconfig.json"*** configuration file. Changing the values in the JSON file will customize the SharePoint list location and/or schema when it is created during deployment.
 <br/>

   ![Quick Start Guide](./Images/Siteconfig1.png) 
     

```
· inclusionPath (SharePoint inclusion path - e.g. sites or teams)

· sitename (SharePoint site name)

· list (SharePoint list for maintaining Champions)

· CName (SharePoint list Column Name for Champions)
```
<br/>

### Known issues

1) If site is presenting with spinning blue circle check to ensure permissions are allowed to the ChampionManagementPlatform sharepoint site. If this is happening on the first load experience ensure that the user running first run experience has permissions to create a SharePoint site (first run creates the initial ChampionManagementPlatform site).If you continue to experience the blue circle, please remove the app from Teams and try again. Visit our issues list to log an issue if issue is still persistent. 

<br/>

2) If new users visit the Champion Management Platform app and receive a blue spinning circle, ensure that you have granted contribute/edit permissions to the SharePoint site created during first run to all users (or scoped users accessing the app). The default site created is ChampionManagementPlatform.

### Frequently Asked Questions

FAQ:


Q. Can we Install in existing site?

A. To maintain permissions and access control, current version of CMP is creating a new site. If you wish to install to a specific existing site you can download the source code and modify the location of SharePoint site the package installs to. This would require a recompile of the package.

Q.Why is profile image not updated with Digital Badge?

A.This happens when the permissions are not being inherited or approved after deploying package. The users must be able to update their profile images and Graph API permissions must have also been approved during package install. 



### Additional Customization Options

The Champion Management Platform is built to provide a great starting point for managing your program. There are several ways you can modify the solution to fit your needs, with some of the major customizations in this current release coming from modifying list and column options once the solution has been deployed. Common actions include:

. Expanding the list of regions / countries / Focus Area / Groups to fit your criteria. Lists provide a very flexible way to provide data points for collection. While we have provided some starter data you will want to modify these values as they are reflected in the Add Members section. This action is done from selecting the list you would like to edit (champion list for this example), selecting the drop down on the column, then navigating to Column settings -> Edit.
<br/>

![Quick Start Guide](./Images/customization.png) 

. You could take similar actions in other lists to modify or add in event types and manual counts for activity logging.
